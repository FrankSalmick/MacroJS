# MacroJS
MacroJS is a CLI-based macro recorder/player. It's written in NodeJS and is cross-platform.

You will need the following npm packages:

- `readline-sync`
- `iohook` (so the recorder can listen to inputs)
- `robotjs` (so the player can play your inputs)

MacroJS is still a WIP.

# Usage

- `node record.js` to record a macro
- `node playback.js` to playback a macros
- `npm start` to start the advanced macro editor
